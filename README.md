Instant professional websites for small grocers through CSV upload - featuring aisle maps, inventory dashboards, and stock alerts to help local stores compete with major chains.
Market Research

I'm currently conducting audience surveys by going door-to-door near local grocery stores to better understand their digital needs. My preliminary findings indicate that our platform would:

1. Significantly improve customer experience
2. Streamline employee training processes
3. Reduce time spent on inventory management
4. Enhance store visibility in local search results
5. Create more engaging digital touchpoints with customers

Roadmap

My development plan includes integration with popular POS systems to enable automatic inventory updates, eliminating the need for manual CSV uploads after initial setup.

P.S. Currently, my supabase is connected to this so please keep in mind that it may repeat products or overlap with yours if you try to use it. It's not a glitch, I'm trying to figure out how to create custom storage integration.
